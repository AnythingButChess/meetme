          <h3>Gaming & Streaming</h3>
          <p>Growing up with Sony and Microsoft battling to see who could have a better console and games to go with allowed me to grow up with some of the best games to this day. This developed my skills for playing and my knowledge for their history. These skill sets help streaming but the best thing I add is new gameshows, chat activities, and career interviews. A stream you can come for serious talk or fun gaming it's the best of both worlds.</p>

          <h3>Exercising</h3>
          <p class="text-under">I didn't fully understand working out and its importance until about the age 22. My first time stepping in the gym since high school I got to see how out of shape I was and have kept up with it since. Personal fitness has come to mean a lot to me for my health both physically AND mentally. Currently training for a mini triathalon so stay tuned! </p>
